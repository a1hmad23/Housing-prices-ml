# üè† Housing Prices Prediction

This project is based on the [Kaggle Housing Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course).  
The goal is to build machine learning models that predict house sale prices from property features.  
It serves as a **learning exercise** and a **portfolio project** showcasing clean project structure, reproducible environments, and a basic ML pipeline.

## Data
   - The project includes a helper function (load_data()) that automatically downloads the Kaggle competition data (train/test) into the datasets/ folder if not already present. You‚Äôll need a Kaggle account and API credentials set up (see Kaggle API docs
).
